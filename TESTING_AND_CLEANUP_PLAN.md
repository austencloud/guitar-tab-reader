# Comprehensive Testing & Cleanup Plan

## Phase 1: Auto-Scroll Functionality Testing

### 1.1 Speed Range Testing

- [ ] Test minimum speed (1 px/s) - should scroll very slowly but visibly
- [ ] Test maximum speed (100 px/s) - should scroll smoothly without jumping
- [ ] Test mid-range speeds (10, 20, 50 px/s) - should respond immediately to changes
- [ ] Test fractional speeds (0.5, 1.5, 2.5 px/s) - should accumulate properly

### 1.2 Dynamic Speed Changes

- [ ] Start at min speed, gradually increase to max - should respond smoothly
- [ ] Start at max speed, gradually decrease to min - should respond smoothly
- [ ] Rapid speed changes (min to max to min) - should not cause jumps or stops
- [ ] Speed changes during active scrolling - should apply immediately

### 1.3 Edge Cases

- [ ] Container with no scrollable content - should not start scrolling
- [ ] Container that becomes scrollable after start - should work properly
- [ ] Reaching bottom of content - should stop automatically
- [ ] Multiple rapid start/stop cycles - should not cause memory leaks
- [ ] Browser tab switching - should handle visibility changes gracefully

### 1.4 User Interaction Testing

- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Space, Arrow keys) - should work during scrolling
- [ ] Manual scrolling during auto-scroll - should not interfere
- [ ] Window resize during scrolling - should continue properly
- [ ] Settings modal during scrolling - should not affect scroll state

## Phase 2: UI Component Testing

### 2.1 Settings Modal

- [ ] Theme switching - should apply immediately without page reload
- [ ] Font size controls - plus/minus buttons aligned with slider
- [ ] Font size preview - should show proper G chord tablature
- [ ] Handedness selection - should show colored selection states
- [ ] Chord diagrams toggle - should work properly
- [ ] Modal keyboard navigation - Escape, Tab, Enter should work
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness - should stack properly on small screens

### 2.2 Scroll Controls

- [ ] Play/pause button - should toggle correctly
- [ ] Speed slider - should update speed in real-time during scrolling
- [ ] Speed display - should show current speed accurately
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts - should work from any focused element
- [ ] Visual feedback - buttons should show correct states

### 2.3 Tab Reader

- [ ] Font size changes - should apply immediately to displayed tabs
- [ ] Theme changes - should update colors smoothly
- [ ] Chord diagrams - should show/hide based on settings
- [ ] Content loading - should handle various tab formats
- [ ] Responsive layout - should work on different screen sizes

## Phase 3: Code Quality & Cleanup

### 3.1 Remove Debug Code

- [ ] Remove all console.log statements from production code
- [ ] Remove commented-out code blocks
- [ ] Remove unused imports and variables
- [ ] Remove placeholder content and TODOs

### 3.2 TypeScript & Linting

- [ ] Fix all TypeScript errors and warnings
- [ ] Run ESLint and fix all issues
- [ ] Ensure proper type definitions for all props and functions
- [ ] Add missing JSDoc comments for public APIs

### 3.3 CSS Cleanup

- [ ] Remove unused CSS classes and variables
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate styles
- [ ] Ensure consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Optimize CSS custom properties usage
- [ ] Remove redundant vendor prefixes

### 3.4 File Organization

- [ ] Remove unused files and components
- [ ] Organize imports consistently
- [ ] Group related functions and components
- [ ] Ensure proper file naming conventions

## Phase 4: Performance & Accessibility

### 4.1 Performance Testing

- [ ] Test with large tab files (1000+ lines)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during long scrolling sessions
- [ ] Test animation frame performance
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks in auto-scroll controller
- [ ] Test on slower devices/browsers

### 4.2 Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation
- [ ] High contrast mode support
- [ ] Focus management in modals
- [ ] ARIA labels and roles verification

### 4.3 Browser Compatibility

- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Phase 5: Automated Testing Setup

### 5.1 Unit Tests

- [ ] AutoScrollController class methods
- [ ] Utility functions (scrollToPosition, etc.)
- [ ] Store functions (preferences, theme)
- [ ] Component prop handling

### 5.2 Integration Tests

- [ ] Settings modal interactions
- [ ] Auto-scroll with speed changes
- [ ] Theme switching across components
- [ ] Font size changes affecting display

### 5.3 E2E Tests

- [ ] Complete user workflow (load tab, adjust settings, auto-scroll)
- [ ] Settings persistence across page reloads
- [ ] Responsive behavior on different screen sizes

## Phase 6: Documentation & Final Cleanup

### 6.1 Code Documentation

- [ ] Update README with current features
- [ ] Document component APIs
- [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic
- [ ] Create developer setup guide

### 6.2 User Documentation

- [ ] Feature overview
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts reference
- [ ] Settings explanation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

### 6.3 Final Verification

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Clean git history
- [ ] Optimized bundle size
- [ ] Production build verification

## Testing Checklist Commands

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Build verification
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Priority Order

1. **HIGH**: Auto-scroll functionality (Phase 1)
2. **HIGH**: Settings modal UI issues (Phase 2.1)
3. **MEDIUM**: Code cleanup and TypeScript (Phase 3)
4. **MEDIUM**: Performance and accessibility (Phase 4)
5. **LOW**: Automated testing setup (Phase 5)
6. **LOW**: Documentation (Phase 6)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Auto-scroll works smoothly at all speed levels
- ✅ Settings modal is visually consistent and functional
- ✅ No console errors or TypeScript warnings
- ✅ All UI components respond correctly to user input
- ✅ Code is clean, well-organized, and maintainable
- ✅ Application works across all target browsers
- ✅ Performance is acceptable on slower devices
